Analysis of Validation Results
Your validation script ran successfully, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test results are:

Model vs NASDAQ-100	D-statistic	p-value
GBM vs NASDAQ-100	0.1212		0.0000
Merton vs NASDAQ-100	0.1214		0.0000
Heston vs NASDAQ-100	0.1271		0.0000

What Do These Results Mean?
1️. D-statistic (D-stat) measures how different two distributions are.

The lower the D-statistic, the better the match.
Heston has the highest D-stat (0.1271), suggesting it deviates the most.
GBM and Merton have slightly lower D-stats (0.1212, 0.1214), indicating better alignment.
2️. p-value = 0.0000 means all models are statistically different from real NASDAQ-100 data.

A p-value close to 1 would mean the models are statistically similar to real data.
A p-value of 0 means the models are not an exact match to NASDAQ-100 returns.
This is expected because no mathematical model perfectly replicates real stock market behavior.

Key Insights from the Histogram Plot
Real NASDAQ-100 returns (black) are tightly centered, with heavier tails.
GBM (blue) and Merton (red) are quite similar in distribution shape.
Heston (green) appears to diverge slightly, likely due to its volatility clustering effect.

Final Takeaways
None of the models are a perfect match (p-value = 0), but this is expected.
GBM and Merton perform similarly, but Merton has a slight advantage in capturing jumps.
Heston diverges more, likely due to its volatility clustering, which may not fully match NASDAQ-100 dynamics.
If needed, Merton could be fine-tuned further to better replicate the NASDAQ-100 return distribution.
