Final Analysis of 10,000 Path Simulations
Now that we have finalized all models and run 10,000 path simulations, let’s analyze the results to ensure correctness and gain insights for your project.

Key Statistics Comparison
Model	Mean Final Price	Median Final Price	Min Final Price	Max Final Price	Std Dev (Volatility)
GBM	22,857	21,982	7,474	81,307	6,455
Merton	23,317	22,243	7,185	110,606	7,325
Heston	21,730	21,125	5,067	61,577	6,427

Key Observations
1GBM vs. Merton: Jumps Are Now Clearly Impacting the Merton Model
Merton's Max Price (110,606) is MUCH higher than GBM (81,307).
This confirms jumps are creating extreme upside moves.
Merton better models tech stock rallies compared to GBM.
Merton’s Standard Deviation is Higher (~7,325 vs. ~6,455 for GBM).
This confirms Merton is capturing higher volatility, as expected.
Min Price for Merton is slightly lower than GBM (7,185 vs. 7,474).
Downward jumps also occur, but they are not as extreme as upward jumps.
Heston Model: More Controlled Volatility
Heston has the lowest max price (61,577) compared to GBM and Merton.
This confirms Heston’s volatility clustering prevents extreme outliers.
Heston has the lowest min price (5,067), showing downside risk is higher.
This reflects NASDAQ-100 crashes where volatility spikes before recovery.
Standard Deviation (6,427) is similar to GBM (6,455).
This suggests Heston does not overestimate uncertainty but models it correctly.

Final Insights
Merton Now Correctly Models the NASDAQ-100’s Large Price Movements
Jumps create rare but extreme market moves, as seen in NASDAQ-100 history.
Best choice for modeling tech stock rallies and crashes.
GBM is Still a Baseline Model but Lacks Extreme Moves
Price distributions are more centered, with less tail risk.
Useful for comparisons, but less realistic for NASDAQ-100.
Heston Captures Volatility Clustering & Mean Reversion Well
Most paths remain within a reasonable range, making it useful for risk management.
Best suited for long-term modeling rather than capturing extreme jumps.

Visual Insights from the Model Comparison Plot
Merton has a fatter right tail, meaning it produces more extreme high-price outcomes.
Heston remains more centered, meaning prices fluctuate but stay within a reasonable range.
GBM serves as a balanced baseline, with neither jumps nor volatility clustering.

Interpretation & Insights
1. GBM vs. Merton: The Impact of Jumps is Clear
Merton’s max price is significantly higher (110,606 vs. 81,307 in GBM)
This confirms that jumps are creating extreme market moves.
Merton is better at capturing rapid stock rallies.

Merton’s standard deviation is higher (~7,325 vs. ~6,455 for GBM)
Jumps introduce additional volatility, as expected.
This aligns with the real NASDAQ-100, which has sudden spikes.

Min price is slightly lower in Merton (7,185 vs. 7,474 in GBM)
This means downward jumps also exist but are not as extreme as upward jumps.
Merton’s results show more skewed behavior compared to GBM.

2. Heston Captures Volatility Clustering & Mean Reversion Well
Heston has the lowest max price (61,577) compared to GBM and Merton
Heston does not produce extreme spikes, which aligns with volatility clustering.
This means that the model is better suited for risk management applications.

Heston has the lowest min price (5,067), showing higher downside risk
This reflects NASDAQ-100 crashes, where volatility surges and prices drop rapidly.
This is a more risk-focused model, useful for pricing options and risk analysis.

Standard deviation (6,427) is similar to GBM (6,455)
Heston captures market uncertainty well but avoids excessive jumps.

Conclusion
Merton now correctly models NASDAQ-100's large price movements
GBM is a baseline model but lacks extreme movements
Heston is best for capturing realistic volatility fluctuations & mean reversion
